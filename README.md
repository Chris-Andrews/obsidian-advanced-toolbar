# Obsidian Advanced Toolbar Plugin [![GitHub tag (Latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/phibr0/obsidian-advanced-toolbar)](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-advanced-toolbar/releases) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/phibr0/obsidian-advanced-toolbar/total)

This Plugin enhances the Mobile Toolbar, enabling it to be always visible and to show multiple Rows at the same time. You can also add Custom Icons for Quick Actions that don't have Icons otherwise.

## Custom Icons

You can add Custom Icons (even [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)) to any Quick Actions that dont have their own Icon already (Please let me know if you want to change Icons of every Quick Action).
For that just go into this Plugin's Settings and if you have any Quick Actions without Icons enabled you can change the Icon via the Button. 

## Theme Developers

This Plugin adds the `advanced-toolbar` CSS Class to the body if its enabled.
You can also use the other classes and variables on body:

- `AT-multirow`: If the toolbar has more than one row
- `AT-row`: If the Row-Layout is enabled
- `AT-Column`: If the Column-Layout is enabled
- `AT-no-toolbar`: If the toolbar is disabled
- `--at-button-height`: Height **of a row**
- `--at-button-width`: Width **of a button**
- `--at-row-count`: Maximal row count
- `--at-spacing`: Spacing between buttons
