This Plugin enhances the Mobile Toolbar, enabling it to be always visible and to show multiple Rows at the same time. You can also add Custom Icons for Quick Actions that don't have Icons otherwise.

## Custom Icons

To add a Custom Icon open the Plugin's Settings and as long as you have Quick Actions that don't have their own Icons, you can add your own here.
Just enter a Name of an Icon into the corresponding Text Field. You can use any [Obsidian internal Icon](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/707816848615407697/830916811116642364) or any [Feather Icon](https://feathericons.com/) prefixed with `feather-`.
